# Nuxt 3 - TailwindCSS

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

**Note**
I was having problems creating a Nuxt3 project with TailwindCSS because of some weird issues. [This](https://github.com/nuxt-community/tailwindcss-module/issues/387#issuecomment-942195100) and [this](https://github.com/nuxt-community/tailwindcss-module/issues/387#issuecomment-944598196) comment helped me fixing it.
In order to help all the other people who also get these weird issues I created this template.
